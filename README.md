# Nuxt Blog

This blog app consists of: 
- front folder: [nuxt app](https://github.com/pavlovt/nuxt-server) for the frontend 
- admin folder: admin interface for adding articles to the db (simple vue + typescript + vuex app)
- backend folder: [koa server](https://github.com/pavlovt/koaql) as an backend for the front and admin apps (for now I am using just the REST without GRAPHQL)
